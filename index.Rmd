<div class="textbox">
  <p>Hello, I'm <a href="about.html">Ada(Yumeng) Qi</a>, a first-year biostatistics student at Columbia University. I'm very grateful for the opportunity to interview with Oracle. I've developed a website using R Markdown, leveraging its interactive functionalities to enhance user engagement and accessibility. Thank you for considering my application.</p>

<div class="textbox">
  <p>In this exploratory <a href="report.html">study</a>, we aim to investigate the frequency of hospitalizations over the past six months and explore potential associations with demographic factors, diabetes-related indicators, quality of life measures, and other health-related variables.</p>

  <p>**Main Research Questions:**</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do diagnosed patients experience a higher frequency of hospitalizations over a six-month period? If so, to what extent?</li>
    <li>Compared to Type 2 Diabetes, are patients with Type 1 Diabetes more likely to adhere to medication regimens? Furthermore, among Type 1 Diabetes patients, does increased non-adherence correlate with a higher frequency of hospitalizations? </li>
    <li>For Type 2 Diabetes patients, how to predict the possibility of hospitalizations in 6 months? </li>
  </ul>
