<h2 class="tabset">Descriptive Analysis</h2>
<p>First, we loaded the dataset and assigned variable types according to
the codebook, identifying 11 factors—6 of which are ordinal—and 11
numeric variables, each with more than five unique values. Below, we
detail the descriptive analysis.</p>
<p>The classification within the <code>DBDX</code> disease factor,
grouping ‘Not diagnosed’ and ‘Not reporting diabetes’ together, raises a
concern. It suggests the potential oversight of individuals who may have
diabetes but remain undiagnosed, inadvertently categorizing them outside
the diagnosed group.For this study, our data primarily concentrate on
life quality scores rather than genetic or other predictors that could
lead to diabetes. Consequently, we have simplified our approach by not
distinguishing between undiagnosed diabetes patients and those who have
not reported the condition. This simplification have made the following
implementations much easier.</p>
<p>We observed that a series of variables related to diabetes diagnosis,
type, and medication show missing values. Given that <code>DBDX</code>,
annotated as ‘Not diagnosed, Missing = Not reporting diabetes,’ is
categorized into am single group, it is logical to treat missing values
in variables directly influenced by <code>DBDX</code> (such as
<code>DBTYPE</code>, <code>DBRX</code>, and <code>DBIN</code>) as 0.</p>
<p>We observed that <code>MMAS</code> is also related to the diagnosis
of diabetes, only people who were diagnosed had records; Since it is
ordinal data, we opted to fill its missing values with -1 to preserve
the original meaning without distortion. Regarding missing values, only
<code>BMI</code> has them, which we will address in a later discussion
on handling such cases.</p>

<h3>Correlation</h3>
<p>Two pairs of variables, <code>MH</code> &amp; <code>MCS</code>,
<code>RP</code> &amp; <code>RPS</code>, exhibit a high correlation
(greater than 0.8), suggesting that one variable from each correlated
pair should be considered for exclusion to avoid multicollinearity.</p>

<h1>Q1.</h1>
<p><strong>Does diagnosed patients have larger frequency of
hospitalizations?</strong></p>
<p>Diagnosed individuals may have a higher rate of hospitalizations due
to the direct implications of managing their condition, which could
include more frequent medical interventions, monitoring, and possible
complications.</p>
<p>We compared <code>RUHP6Q</code> values between diagnosed and
non-diagnosed groups via a bar plot, noticing many zeros, indicating
overdispersion and the potential need for specialized models. The
diagnosed group showed higher means and standard errors, as
expected.</p>
<p>Before building regression model, we used <code>DEAGE</code>,
<code>BMI</code>, and <code>DESEX</code> to build a propensity score
model with DBDX. This helped account for baseline differences that could
affect both the likelihood of disease and the outcomes
<code>RUHP6Q</code>.PSM helped ensure that the comparison between
diagnosed and non-diagnosed groups in subsequent NB and ZINB regressions
is fair and balanced.Almost 99.9% in the diagnosed group was matched 1-1
to the non-diagnosed group. We then applied negative binomial regression
and zero-inflated models, with a detailed summary available in the
hidden code section.</p>

<p>The Negative Binomial regression analysis reveals a significant
difference in <code>RUHP6Q</code> between groups defined by
<code>DBDX</code>. Specifically, the <code>DBDX1</code> coefficient is
positive and significant, indicating that being in the diagnosed group
is associated with a higher count of <code>RUHP6Q</code>, compared to
the non-diagnosed group. The model’s fit is underscored by a substantial
difference between the null and residual deviance, and a relatively low
theta suggests overdispersion. The model’s AIC provides a measure for
comparing with alternative models. The coefficient for
<code>DBDX1</code> suggests that diagnosed individuals have a <span
class="math inline">\(e^{0.6779} \approx 1.97\)</span> times higher rate
of hospitalizations in the past 6 months compared to those not
diagnosed, all else being equal. This indicates a significant impact of
diagnosis on hospitalization frequency.</p>
<p>As for the Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model fitted to
<code>RUHP6Q</code> against <code>DBDX</code>. In the count model,
<code>DBDX1</code> has a positive coefficient, indicating an association
between being in the <code>DBDX1</code> group and an increase in the
<code>RUHP6Q</code> count. The significant negative coefficient for
<code>Log(theta)</code> suggests overdispersion in the data. The
zero-inflation part’s intercept is significant, suggesting different
levels of zero counts not explained by the count model alone, but the
<code>DBDX1</code> effect is not significant here, indicating no clear
difference in zero-inflation between <code>DBDX</code> groups.</p>
<p>As the Negative Binomial regression model suggested, diagnosed
individuals have around 1.97 times higher rate of hospitalizations in
the past 6 months compared to those not diagnosed.This association
underscores the healthcare needs and challenges faced by those diagnosed
with conditions requiring ongoing treatment or observation.</p>

<p><strong>For Type 1 Diabetes patients, does higher MMAS lead to lower
frequency of hospitalizations?</strong></p>
<p>Specifically focusing on Type 1 diabetes patients, we constructed a
negative binomial regression model. Given that the Morisky Medication
Adherence Score (MMAS) variable only takes 5 unique values, we treated
it as categorical data, resulting in a slightly complex interpretation.
Comparing patients with <code>MMAS</code> = 0 to those with
<code>MMAS</code> = 1,2 we found that the former group had approximately
<span class="math inline">\(e^{0.4924} \approx 1.64\)</span> times
higher rates of hospitalizations in the past 6 months, while the latter
group had approximately <span class="math inline">\(e^{0.1285} \approx
1.14\)</span> times higher rates. However, for higher levels of
<code>MMAS</code> (<code>MMAS</code>= 3,4), they exhibited the opposite
effect, suggesting potentially confounding factors such as limited
sample size.</p>
<p>The statement “higher levels of MMAS lead to higher rates of
hospitalization” might seem counterintuitive, especially given the
expectation that better medication adherence (higher MMAS scores) should
lead to better health outcomes and, consequently, lower rates of
hospitalization. However, several factors could explain this apparent
contradiction:</p>
<p><em>Confounding Variables</em>: There might be confounding variables
that are not accounted for in the analysis. These variables could
influence both MMAS and hospitalization rates simultaneously, leading to
a spurious association between MMAS and hospitalization.</p>
<p><em>Reverse Causality</em>: It’s possible that the relationship
between MMAS and hospitalization is bidirectional. In other words, not
only does medication adherence affect hospitalization rates, but
hospitalization experiences could also influence future medication
adherence. For example, individuals who have experienced frequent
hospitalizations may become more vigilant about medication adherence,
resulting in higher MMAS scores.</p>
<p><em>Disease Severity</em>: Higher MMAS scores might be associated
with more severe or poorly managed health conditions, which could
increase the risk of hospitalization. For instance, patients with
chronic conditions who struggle to adhere to their medication regimens
may experience disease progression, leading to exacerbations and
hospital admissions.</p>

<h1>Q3.</h1>
<p><strong>For Type2 DB patients, how to predict the possibility of
hospitalizations in 6 months?</strong></p>
<p>According to <a
href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/symptoms-causes">the
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease</a>, the
causes of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are quite distinct. Type 1 diabetes
is believed to occur when the immune system attacks and destroys
insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, with genetics and
environmental factors like viruses potentially triggering this
autoimmune response. Type 2 diabetes is primarily caused by lifestyle
factors and genetics, including being overweight, physically inactive,
and having insulin resistance. Obesity and physical inactivity increase
the risk, and the disease often runs in families, being more common in
certain racial/ethnic groups. Also, Type 1 is an autoimmune condition
with onset typically in younger individuals, requiring insulin
management from the start. Type 2, more prevalent and influenced by
lifestyle and genetics, usually appears in adults but is increasingly
found in younger populations due to lifestyle factors. Management may
start with lifestyle changes and medication, with insulin needed as the
condition progresses.</p>
<p>Given the distinct nature of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, it is
prudent to develop predictive models separately for each type. Due to
the limited sample size available for Type 1 diabetes, our focus was
directed solely towards Type 2.</p>

<p>The LASSO regression model, used for variable selection and
shrinkage, indicates key factors influencing the number of
hospitalizations in the past 6 months (<code>RUHP6Q</code>). We used
cross validation to find the best performed hyperpramater(highest AUC).
Certainly, here’s the completion of the paragraph:</p>
<p>The bar plot displays the estimate of coefficients from the lasso
regression, wherein we filtered only those with an absolute value larger
than 0. Among these variables, <code>DBIN1</code> (indicating the use of
insulin) exhibits a significant positive association, suggesting that
individuals requiring insulin are more likely to experience frequent
hospitalizations. This association may stem from the fact that insulin
therapy is often prescribed to individuals with more severe forms of
diabetes, necessitating closer medical monitoring and potentially
leading to a higher likelihood of hospital admissions. Additionally, the
variable <code>CCI</code> (Charlson comorbidity index) also demonstrates
a positive association with the outcome. This finding aligns with
expectations, as a greater burden of comorbidities, as captured by the
Charlson index, is likely to increase the complexity of patient care and
thereby contribute to a higher frequency of hospitalizations. Moreover,
<code>VT</code> (Vitality quality of life) exhibits a positive impact on
the outcome and increases the likelihood of hospital admissions. One
possible reason for this unexpected association could be that
individuals with higher vitality levels may engage in more active
lifestyles, leading to a higher risk of accidents or injuries that
require hospitalization. Additionally, individuals with higher vitality
levels may overexert themselves or push beyond their physical limits,
potentially increasing the likelihood of health complications that
necessitate hospital care.</p>
<p>The negative impact observed for <code>PF</code> and <code>SF</code>
on the likelihood of hospitalization aligns with the expectation that
better physical and social functioning are associated with improved
overall health outcomes, reduced susceptibility to illness or injury,
and enhanced support mechanisms that help individuals manage their
health needs outside of hospital settings.</p>
<p>Variables like <code>BMI</code> and <code>DESEX2</code> (Female) also
contribute to the model, albeit with smaller and in some cases negative
coefficients, affecting the hospitalization rate differently. Notably,
<code>BMI</code> has a negative coefficient, suggesting that higher BMI
is associated with fewer hospitalizations, which may require further
investigation to understand the underlying context.</p>
<p>It’s important to consider the possibility of confounding variables
or complex interactions within the dataset that may influence the
relationship among predictors and hospital admissions. Further
investigation, including additional analyses or exploration of
underlying mechanisms, may be necessary to fully understand this
association.</p>

<p>The model’s performance is characterized by excellent specificity
(1.00) indicating all negative cases are correctly identified. However,
the sensitivity is exceptionally low at 0.0173, meaning the model
identifies very few positive cases. The accuracy is high (0.8791), which
seems impressive, but it is misleading due to the class imbalance
reflected in the prevalence rate (0.1230). The Kappa score is low
(0.0300), suggesting that the agreement between the predicted and actual
values is only slightly better than chance. The AUC of 0.7118 indicates
a fair ability to distinguish between the classes. These metrics
together suggest that while the model is excellent at predicting the
negative class, it fails to adequately capture the positive class,
likely due to class imbalance.</p>
